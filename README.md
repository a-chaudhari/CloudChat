# CloudChat

CloudChat is a web-based IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client.  It's built using React.JS, CSS3, and HTML5 on the front-end and Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL on the back-end.

CloudChat is not only an IRC webclient, but it also functions as an IRC bouncer.  Meaning, it will act as a proxy for the user and maintain an IRC connection indefinitely, store messages on a server-side buffer which will be replayed when the user reconnects, and can allow multiple client devices access to a single connection.
